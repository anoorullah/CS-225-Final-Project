## Week 2 Development Log (4/5 - 4/11)

#### Goals: 
Complete, working BFS algorithm, at least initial implementation of djikstra's

#### What we achieved: 
Adnan: Fixed the data loader. The files are now properly being parsed. Also assisted Kamran in the implementation of the BFS algorithm. The BFS algorithm is now completely working and the data we need is now properly assigned.

Yousuf: Assisted Adnaan with the loaders. Worked with Adnaan and Ebaad to organize the plans of implementation for BST and Djikstra's Algorithms.

#### Problems we encountered:
Meeting in person is still a challenge for us. We are planning to mitigate this by meeting more than once a week to make sure we are communicating well. Besides this, we have not encountered many issues this week. We were able to accomplish all our goals for the week, with a completed, working data parser and a complete, working BFS implementation. Kamran also has an implementation of Djikstra that we are still working on. Only one person is able to code while we are working together to avoid merge conflicts.

#### Next week's plans:
Our plans for next week are as follows: A complete, functioning implementation of Djikstra's algorithm, along with an initial implementation of the betweenness centrality algorithm. We also want to create tests and also print the results of our function in preparation for the midpoint meeting with Amit and to make sure that our algorithms are properly working.
