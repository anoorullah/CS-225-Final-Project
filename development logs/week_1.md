## Week 1 Development Log (3/28 - 4/4)

#### Goals: 
Implement Data Processing, BFS

#### What we achieved: 
Adnan: I completed a very rough, initial data loader and parser (processing), which reads from the two separate data files (airports and routes) and also added a file which takes the spherical distance between two airports and assigns that value to the weight of that edge. We are planning to continue adding to the data processing file as we add our algorithms to this project, and I also plan to make the file clearer to understand. The AirportLoader file, which calculates the edge weight, will be used to help in our implementation of Djikstra's algorithm and perhaps betweenness centrality as well.

Yousuf: Minor adjustments to Adnan's code, added a few things. 

Kamran: Implemented an edge class to create weighted and unweighted edges, and a routes class to create and compare routes. 

#### Problems we encountered:
As Ramadan was arriving this week, we fell behind as a team working on the project, as our preparations conflicted with our ability to start coding for this project. Our schedules also did not align well, and we were not able to meet over Zoom or in-person. Hence, we were not able to complete the BFS algorithm as we had (ambitiously) hoped. We are planning to pick up more work and increase the frequency of team meetings this week in order to get back on track with the completion of this project. The plans for the future development logs also reflects this.

#### Next week's plans:
Our plans for the next week of development is to have a completed BFS algorithm, much more well-rounded and complete data processing, and at least an initial implementation of Djikstra's algorithm.
