# CS225 Final Project: Written Report 

## Introduction
To start, we downloaded the OpenFlights airport and routes data. This data is stored in a CSV format, and each line represents the corresponding airport or flight. Each airport has an ID, name, and latitude and longitude values. This data was then parsed with edge case checks in place to ignore missing and null data. After being parsed, the data was converted into a vector of strings to create 'Airport' objects. Each Airport object has an unordered_map which stores adjacent airports and its path. When inserting edges, we first calculate the weight of the edge with the coordinates of the two airports. In our design, the airports are the vertices, and the edges are the flights with weight being the distance. When inserting redundant edges, only the first one is inserted to keep the graph simple. In conclusion, we created a graph class that supports the insertion of vertices into the graph, the creation and insertion of edges and the fetching of vertices, adjacent vertices, their data, and the weight between them.

## BFS Traversal 
For our traversal, we implemented three Breadth First Search functions, following the
basic algorithms presented in lecture. The first BFS function traverses through the whole graph
given a starting airport, the second one traverses up to a given move, and the last one traverses
until the given destination airport is reached. All of these functions utilize the queue data
structure, and their outputs are vectors of strings of the name of the passing airports. For testing,
we started with small datasets and checked the traversal by hand. We then tested the BFS_moves
by comparing the length to the number of moves and the first element of the vector with the
starting airport. To test BFS_dest, we compared the starting and ending airports to the start and
end of the output vector. The running time of our BFS traversals are O(m+n), which is relatively
fast.

## Djikstra's Algorithm
The first algorithm we implemented was Djikstraâ€™s algorithm for finding the shortest path
between two airports. This function outputs a list of vertices that follow, in order, the shortest
path between two airports, as well as the path length. We used a priority queue to maintain the
airports that we were finding on the way to locating the shortest path, as well as a map to keep
track of the airports and from where they were flown to. We also maintained unordered maps to
keep track of airports that were visited. What we found interesting after running this algorithm
on multiple combinations of airports, is that even if a path with fewer stops is available, it is
sometimes more efficient from a flight distance perspective to stop at more airports along the
way. Each edge in the algorithm run process is viewed at most two times, and each node is
viewed at most two times (as you add it to the queue and then remove it). Since we used a
priority queue as a data structure for keeping the vertices as we visit them, it takes constant time
to queue the node and log time to query it. So the total run time is O(|E|+|V|log(|V|)).

## PageRank Algorithm
The last algorithm we implemented was a Page Rank algorithm. The Page Rank algorithm, in
this project, is used to evaluate the importance of the airports. Our implementations of this
algorithm produces two vectors. One vector contains the ID of each airport and the other includes
the evaluation of each airport. A function which can extract the most important airports can
utilize those two vectors to reveal the ID of the most important airports. The first step of this
algorithm is extracting the adjacent matrix out of a graph object. To do this, we first check
through the vertices of the unordered map of the graph, extracting the ID of the airports, and put
them into a vector which will be used as a reference later. Then, the flights of each airport are
reached. The weight of each flight is acquired and stored in the adjacent matrix in the order
specified by the ID list. Before the Page Rank algorithm is to be performed, the matrix should be
adjusted to fulfill the requirements. A function will first normalize the column vectors of the
matrix to ensure the sum of each column vector is one. If an airport has no outgoing edge, the
sum should be zero. In this case, each entry of the column vector will be adjusted to
1/vector.size. After the normalization procedure, the adjacent matrix will be further modified
according to the description of Page Rank algorithm. Each value will be set to the product of
itself with the damping factor plus (1 - damping factor) / vector.size.

Then, a starting vector can be generated with random numbers. Calculating the product of
the matrix and the starting vector will generate another vector which reveals the future state of
the airport of the current state, which is specified by the starting vector. If we keep multiplying the
vector with the adjacent matrix, the result vector will approach a stable state,
which then can be used to rank the importance of the airports.
To validate our implementation, a subset of the flight data was
gathered. After running the implementation
with the whole data set, our most important airport is Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. This result is also inline with reality. Thus, we conclude that our implementation of the Page Rank algorithm meets our expectations. The runtime of Page Rank is O(k * n), where k is the number of iterations.

## Answer to Leading Question 
#### What is the real-world application of the algorithms that we've learned? For example, how should we map the data to the graph so that our implementation of the Dijkstra's algorithm can help find out the shortest path of two airports? How do we optimize airline routes given different goals?
The algorithms and traversals that we covered in class, Dijkstra's and BFS, specifically, have practical use-cases in the real-world - especially in our particular use of the OpenFlights dataset. We were able to use Dijkstra's to find the shortest path between airports and BFS to traverse routes between airports. Also, we were able to implement PageRank to find the most important airports in our dataset. Overall, we learned a lot about various algorithms that we did not have any knowledge of beforehand. In the future, we could make a visual representation of the flights, including connections and distances between them.
