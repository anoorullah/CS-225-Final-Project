## Week 3 Development Log (4/12 - 4/18)

#### Goals: 
Complete djikstra's and have an initial implementation of betweeness centrality algorithm (changed to PageRank algoritm, reflected in proposal)

#### What we achieved: 
Adnan: Worked with Kamran and Ebaad on Djikstra's algorithm. Prepared for midpoint presentation by cleaning up files and uploading to GitHub.

Ebaad: Worked with Kamran and Adnan on Djikstra's algorithm. Mostly focused on commenting and helping with any bugs. Created some test cases for Djikstra, but they are still in development.

Yousuf: Added folders and files for Catch, CS225, Make, and made test cases

Kamran: Worked with Ebaad and Adnan on Djikstra's algorithm. Helped Adnan clean up files for midpoint presentation.

#### Problems we encountered:
We were busy preparing for the midpoint presentation; hence, we cleaned up the files that needed to be cleaned. We did not have many problems this week. Communication is still somewhat of an issue, but we were able to meet, both over Zoom and in person to accomplish our goals for this week. We did not focus on the betweenness centrality algorithm this week.

#### Next week's plans:
An implemented betweenness centrality algorithm (changed to PageRank algoritm, reflected in proposal)
