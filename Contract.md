## CS 225 Data Structures
Team Contract
Communication
#### Team Meetings: 
Twice a week, Mondays and Thursdays, 6PM CST/5PM EST (each
45-60 mins long). We will continue to use discord for our meetings as we all enjoy using
discord more than zoom. We will just write down what they still need to work on or
complete by themselves we trust everyone to do their own work in a timely manner and
meet the deadlines.
#### Assistance: 
Teammates can easily contact each other through our discord group chat, or
if necessary directly by text message. Everyone is expected to respond within a
reasonable time frame, circumstances permitting.
#### Respect: 
Every meeting will start off with a round robin on the progress of each member
so far at that point, as well as ideas and topics they would like to share with the team.
There will be a document in the repo to update if any teammates have new ideas or topics
that need to be discussed in the next upcoming github.
Collaboration
#### Work Distribution: 
Every Monday stand-up will include a portion where we assess the
progress made the previous week, and assign/reassign equal amounts of work to each
team member. If there are scheduling conflicts that week for certain team members,
based on majority consensus, team members may be relieved of some work for a certain
week. Each team member is expected to be the same level and therefore expected to
produce equal amounts of work.
#### Time Commitment:
Each team member is expected to put in 15 hours of work each
week leading up to the end of this project. Each team member is not expected to be
working precisely at the same time with any other team member.
#### Conflict Resolution: 
All conflicts are expected to be resolved through majority vote if it
pertains to something that affects the direction of the project as a whole. (Coin flip
resolves ties) Minor conflicts are expected to be resolved through respective teammates
since we are not children and are big boy college students. Any delays in expected
progress should be communicated early so that team members can anticipate ahead of
time. Failure to do so can possibly result in the issue now being brought up to the course
staff.
