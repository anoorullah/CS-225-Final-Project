## Week 4 Development Log (4/19 - 4/25)

#### Goals: 
Completed PageRank Algorithm

#### What we achieved:
Adnan: Assisted Yousuf in researching PageRank algorithm and helped Kamran with the development of the algorithm. Cleaned up files and looking to add more descriptive comments.

Ebaad: Committed some tests written by Kamran for the Pagerank algorithm

#### Problems we encountered:
We were facing difficulty while deciding how to implement the betweennness centrality algorithm; hwnce, we decided to change our final algorithm to PageRank. Besides this, we were able to continue functioning well as a group and communication has improved tremendously. We were able to complete the PageRank algorithm, as well as add tests. We are looking to continue adding tests and comments, as well as debug to try and catch any errors. We will be making our presentation next week and submitting it for grading.

#### Next week's plans:
Completed project, completed testing suite, debugging, presentation
