### Comments
The team has done an amazing job so far, they have implemented and tested data parsing and BFS.

They have implemented Dijkstra's and are in the process of testing it.

The team is deciding to switch their third uncovered algorithm from betweeness centrality to Page Rank and will let me know in the next couple of days about the change. I asked them to update their proposal and email me.
